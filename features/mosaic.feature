Feature: Japanese Mosaic logic puzzle

  The Japanese Mosaic logic puzzle is a derivative of the Nonogram puzzle form invented by
  Tetsuya Nishio.
  It consists of a grid with the cells containing either the numbers 0 to 9 or nothing.
  The number in a cell tells you how many of itself and its neighbours are filled in.
  For our consideration we shall consider a filled in cell one with a # in it.

  A 0 in a cell means that none of the neighbour cells or itself can be filled in.
  If a 0 constraint contradicts another constraint the 0 constraint always takes priority.

  The puzzle is complete when you have filled in all the squares that the constraints allow.
